## **Uncetainty**

Knowledge usually comes along with some uncertainty. This also happens to predictons.

## Probability

* P(w): probability of a "world"
* 0 ≤ P(w) ≤ 1
* Sum over all w of P(w) = 1

* **Unconditional probability:** degree of belief in a proposition in the absence of any other evidence.

* **Conditional probability:** degree of belief in a proposition given some other proposition.

* Bayes' Theorem: P(a|b)P(b) = P(b|a)P(a)

## Bayesian Network

* directed graph
* each node represents a random variable
* arrow from X to Y means X is a Prent of Y
* each node X has probabulity distribution P(X|parents(X) )
