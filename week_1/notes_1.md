# **Lecture Notes 1**

## **Knowledge**

* Conclussions based on information.
* We will try to take the *knowledge* concept to AI.
  * **knowledge-based agents**

## **Logic**

### **Sentence**

* An assertion about the world in a knowledge representation language

### **Propositional logic**

* **Proposition symbols**: Letters represent a single proposition.

* **Logical connectiveness**: not, and, or, implication, biconditional

* **Truth table**: shows the truth table for a sentence

## **Model**

* Assigns a true value to every propositional symbol in a sentence.

## **Knowledge-base**

* A set of sentences known by a knowledge-based agent.

## **Entailment**

* **alpha entails beta**

In every model in which alpha is true, beta is also true.

## **Inference**

* Deriving new sentences from old ones.

The goal of our knowledge-based AI is to anser the question: *does our knowledge base entail alpha?*
